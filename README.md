# Linear Regression: Study Hours vs Exam Marks

This project demonstrates a simple linear regression model to predict **exam marks** based on **hours studied**. The data used in the model is contained in the `student marks simple linear.csv` file.

## Components:
- **Jupyter Notebook**: The `Student marks predictions.ipynb` file contains step-by-step code and analysis for building and evaluating the linear regression model.
- **Data**: The `student marks simple linear.csv` file contains the dataset used for training the model.

## Data:
The dataset consists of **study hours** and **exam marks**, the data is the same but in the code it was generated not read from the file, for learning purposees.

### Sample Data:
```csv

3	65
4	70
5	75
6	78
7	85
